# Lesson Plans

## Year 1

Our teacher PD will first prepare teachers with the foundational knowledge they need in AI and NLP through engaging, hands-on learning. Once teachers have established this foundational knowledge, they will engage with the research team in co-design of the problem-based inquiry activities that integrate NLP into middle school science. The co-design efforts will pave the way for a first classroom implementation in year 1. By the end of the teacher PD and co-design experiences, teachers will have developed knowledge of NLP practices integrated into science.

## Year 2

In Year 2, we will conduct a second summer teacher professional development. This workshop will include the 4 teachers from Year 1 and will recruit an additional 4 teachers. Year 2â€™s teacher workshop will also engage in more co-design sessions with a focus on lesson study. After the summer teacher professional development session, we will deploy Classroom Implementation 2, the second iteration of IntegrateAI with 8 teachers and 720 students. In this iteration, we will administer pre/post assessments that were refined based on the classroom work of Year 1. 

## Year 3

In Year 3, we will conduct the third teacher PD and co-design workshop, this time with the 8 teachers from Year 2 and an additional 4 teachers recruited for Year 3. A total of 12 teachers (6 from FL and 6 from IN) will engage in a final round of refinement on the learning materials and assessments based on lessons learned from previous years. We will then proceed to conduct Classroom Implementation 3.
