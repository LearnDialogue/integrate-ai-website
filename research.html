                Of AI’s many subfields, natural language processing (NLP) is one
                of the fastest growing. “Natural language” refers to the ways
                humans communicate with each other, be it through speech, such
                as in-person conversations and phone calls, or text, such as
                Twitter, news articles, and text messages. Billions of natural
                language exchanges happen and are recorded online everyday. With
                NLP, people can harness the power of AI to automatically
                understand huge datasets of natural language to answer pressing
                questions that could benefit society. For example, NLP
                researchers have long analyzed Google searches related to “flu
                remedies” to create maps of influenza outbreaks before affected
                people report their illness to medical authorities. Researchers
                have also used Twitter data from severe weather events such as
                hurricanes and blizzards to catalog how people talk about
                warnings and responses. This project is led by PI Kristy
                Elizabeth Boyer, PI Krista Glazewski (School of Education,
                Indiana University), co-PI Mehmet Celepkolu (Computer Science,
                University of Florida), Co-PI Cindy Hmelo-Silver (School of
                Education, Indiana University), Co-PI Asmalina Saleh (Center for
                Research on Learning and Teaching, Indiana University), Co-PI
                Thomas Brush (School of Education, Indiana University).

                Project IntegrateAI will integrate AI learning through NLP into
                middle school science through participatory co-design with
                middle school teachers. Middle school science provides an
                excellent context for integrating NLP because of the focus on
                inquiry-oriented science and the value in being able to identify
                and use textual resources. Project IntegrateAI will bring
                potentially transformative learning experiences to middle school
                teachers and students: for teachers, we will support development
                of competencies (knowledge and skills around NLP and science;
                ethical reasoning) as well as achieve a sense of preparedness to
                bring authentic, inquiry-based NLP experiences into their
                science classrooms. For students, these innovative experiences
                will foster competencies (knowledge and skills around NLP and
                science; ethical reasoning) and attitudes toward STEM careers
                (interest, identity, and intention to persist).

                  <p>
                    Project IntegrateAI’s theory of action centers on
                    co-designing classroom activities with teachers through
                    robust teacher professional development (PD) in NLP, and
                    links these innovative technologies to meaningful classroom
                    practice. The PD prepares teachers on the Big Ideas of AI,
                    and supports their ability to integrate NLP into their
                    science classrooms. This co-design approach ensures teachers
                    feel ownership of the ideas they are teaching in their
                    classrooms.

                    NLP functions that accompany their science learning
                    activities, and a structured interface, which provides a
                    rich set of extensions to generate interactive graphs and

                    Leveraging practices from Problem-Based Learning (PBL),
                    IntegrateAI is designed to flexibly integrate with middle
                    school science classrooms and provide rich, contextual,
                    in-depth exposure to AI integrated into science. The
                    integrated curriculum draws on the NGSS three-dimensional
                    learning framework as a means to articulate key dimensions
                    of AI integrated into science.
