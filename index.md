# Integrate AI

Natural language data is everywhere around us: news articles, social media posts, Youtube transcripts, TikTok comments, and much more. Large amounts of this natural language data are related to scientific phenomena such as the weather, health and diseases, engineering, and conservation. Project IntegrateAI will engage learners in authentic, inquiry-driven projects to investigate scientific questions using this natural language data. We will leverage the power of artificial intelligence that harnesses computers to process huge amounts of data in fractions of a second. The same data would take weeks or even years for humans to read. This powerful field of artificial intelligence is called Natural Language Processing (NLP).


Project IntegrateAI will bring innovative NLP-based learning experiences into middle school science through participatory co-design with middle school teachers. For teachers, we will support development of competencies as well as achieve a sense of preparedness to bring authentic, inquiry-based NLP experiences into their science classrooms. For students, we hypothesize that these innovative experiences will foster competencies (knowledge and skills around NLP and science; ethical reasoning) and attitudes toward STEM careers (interest, identity, and intention to persist)
